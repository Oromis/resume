I love to design & implement solutions for complex IT problems. I design software systems to be prepared for change instead of fearing change. Security and efficiency are of utmost importance to me.\n\nI am an expert programmer. I learned to code in my teenage years and went on to teach myself language after language, technology after technology. I strive for clean and efficient solutions. Automated testing is second nature to me and I use Test-Driven Development whenever possible.\n\nI am versatile. I've worked professionally in various fields - including Real-Time Embedded Systems, Database Engineering, Full-Stack Web Development, App Development and server management and administration. In addition, I am no stranger to electronics, engineering, business processes and conducting interviews.\n\nI am a leader. I combine technical competence with the social skills required to lead and motivate a team - all this while listening to the wishes, needs and suggestions from the team members. I am willing and able to make tough decisions and I take the blame for my failures.\n\nI am not a scientist. I am not someone who invents new algorithms on a world-class level."
